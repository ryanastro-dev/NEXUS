# Professional Code Review (2026 Focused)

## Executive Summary

As of February 8, 2026, the backend and frontend integration path is in a healthy state based on compile, lint, and test validation. The latest UI refactor and Mission Control polish commit (`04e74da`) did not introduce detected regressions in automated checks.

Current maturity snapshot:
- Product scope: Advanced for a v0.3.x desktop network intelligence tool.
- Architecture: Strong Rust modularity (`scanner`, `network`, `database`, `alerts`, `monitor`, `insights`, `exports`) and clearer frontend command boundary via `tauriClient`.
- Reliability: Root Rust crate, Tauri crate, and frontend build pipeline all passing.
- Security posture: Improved, but still needs least-privilege hardening before strict production rollout.
- 2026 readiness: Medium-high.

## Final Validation Update (2026-02-08)

Validated locally:
- `cargo check --all-targets` (root) passed.
- `cargo clippy --all-targets` (root) passed.
- `cargo test --all-targets` (root) passed.
  - Included `database::schema::tests::test_legacy_alerts_schema_migrates_dedupe_key_before_index`.
  - Included `tests::test_alert_generation_and_dedupe_across_two_consecutive_scans`.
- `cargo check --all-targets` (`apps/nexus-desktop/src-tauri`) passed.
- `cargo clippy --all-targets` (`apps/nexus-desktop/src-tauri`) passed.
- `cargo test --all-targets` (`apps/nexus-desktop/src-tauri`) passed (0 tests, compile/runtime harness healthy).
- `npm --prefix apps/nexus-desktop run build` passed.
- `npm --prefix apps/nexus-desktop run tauri info` passed (toolchain/runtime environment healthy).

Integration contract spot-check:
- Tauri invoke commands exposed in `apps/nexus-desktop/src-tauri/src/main.rs`: 29.
- Commands mapped in `apps/nexus-desktop/src/lib/api/tauri-client.ts`: 29.
- Parity check result: no missing command mappings.

## Findings (Current)

### High

No blocking/high-severity defects were reproduced in the final validation pass.

### Medium

1. App runtime was validated through compile/lint/test/build, not full GUI/E2E flows.
- Impact: "Bug-free" cannot be guaranteed for interactive workflows (real scan UX, modal flows, long-session behavior) without manual/E2E execution.
- Recommendation: add Playwright (or equivalent) desktop E2E smoke tests for start/stop scan, alerts workflow, exports, and settings persistence.

2. Frontend command access is mostly centralized, but there are still two command-call paths.
- `tauriClient` is now the main integration layer, but `apps/nexus-desktop/src/hooks/useMonitoring.tsx` still uses direct `invoke`/`listen`.
- Impact: increases maintenance overhead and risk of drift in error handling patterns.
- Recommendation: migrate monitoring invokes/listeners behind a single typed service facade.

### Low

1. Contract generation is still manual between Rust and TypeScript.
- Impact: drift risk is reduced but not eliminated.
- Recommendation: add generated shared types/schemas (`ts-rs`, `specta`, or schema snapshots + compatibility tests).

2. Production hardening gaps remain.
- Tauri capabilities/CSP and local key handling should be reviewed under a strict least-privilege policy before release packaging.

## Major Completed Fixes (Still Confirmed)

1. Alert dedupe correctness and integration coverage.
- Consecutive-scan dedupe integration test is passing.
- Dedupe behavior no longer relies on mutable IP identity.

2. Legacy database migration safety.
- `alerts.dedupe_key` migration ordering fix remains validated.

3. Data consistency and runtime robustness.
- `is_randomized` persistence/migration fixes remain intact.
- Prior panic-prone runtime paths improved with explicit error handling.

4. UI integration and design modernization.
- Typed Tauri client introduced and applied broadly.
- Dashboard/utilities pages now use a consistent Mission Control visual system.
- Typography consistency micro-pass completed across primary pages.

## Recommended Next Steps

1. Add desktop E2E smoke tests and run in CI.
- Minimum path: scan start/stop, alerts read/clear, tools actions, exports, settings persistence.

2. Fully consolidate frontend command transport.
- Move remaining direct `invoke` usage into the same typed client/service.

3. Enforce strict release gates.
- Include `cargo fmt --check`, `cargo clippy -- -D warnings`, root+tauri checks/tests, and `npm --prefix apps/nexus-desktop run build`.

4. Harden desktop security defaults.
- Revisit CSP/capabilities and key-management approach for production profile.

## Bottom Line

The codebase is in a strong state for the current phase: backend, frontend, and Tauri bridge validate cleanly with no reproduced blocking defects. Remaining work is now primarily release hardening and automated runtime assurance (E2E), not core correctness triage.
